Worm2D uses OpenGL for 2D rendering.
Features, *Ahem*:
-Initialize a pygame/openGL window (resolution independant).
-Single or multiple viewports (each with screen position and resolution).
-Loads and displays pygame supported image files. (including NonPowerOfTwo).
-Displayes pygame fonts.
-Loads frames packed into into a single image.
-Do openGL calls from anywhere.
-So far, it has been tested on windows and ubuntu (xubuntu, if it makes a difference), but it should work on others.

If you want to use Worm2D, just copy and paste worm2d.py into the directory where your code is.
