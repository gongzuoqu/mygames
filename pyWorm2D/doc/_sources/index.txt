Welcome to Worm2D's documentation!
==================================

Worm2D is a 2D opengl hardware accelerated rendering engine. It has all the drawing features needed for a simple game, but if you need more, any OpenGL or Pygame call can be used directly. 
Worm2D can be used as a starting point (window initialization, image loading), and then more advanced features can easily be added from there.
